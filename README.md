This is a Mongodb luks encryption script designed for Ubuntu.

Assumptions:
This script assumes that the device needing to be formatted and encrypted is /dev/sdb
Be sure to copy and store the generated encryption key file from /root

Notes:
The secondary drive will be mounted at /var/lib/mongodb as this is the default location for MongoDB data files on Ubuntu and Mongo at least v2.6 

Enjoy!!!  :-)
